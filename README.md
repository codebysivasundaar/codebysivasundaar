# 👋 Hey there, I'm Sivasundaar

<p align="center">
  🎯 <strong>Aspiring Data Scientist</strong> &nbsp;|&nbsp; 
</p>

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently diving deep into the world of data — from wrangling datasets and crafting powerful SQL queries to building models and extracting insights that matter.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning
- 📊 SQL for Data Analysis
- 🐍 Python for data manipulation and visualization
- 📈 Machine Learning fundamentals
- 📦 Tools like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib

## 🔨 Projects Coming Soon
- A collection of SQL challenges and solutions
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real-world datasets
- End-to-end data science projects (with Jupyter notebooks)

## 🌱 What's Next?
I'm constantly learning and applying new skills, aiming to transition into a data science role where I can turn raw data into actionable insights.
